1. Dennis Ritchie, the creator of the C programming language,
was born on September 9th, 1941.  If he were still alive,
how old would he be today?  Find out by running the `birthday`
program on the appropriate inputs and enter your solution here.
Answer:
Answer from program.
Today is 2023/10/05
Your birthday was 1841/09/09
Hello, Dennis.  You are 0 years, 0 weeks, and 0 days old today




2. Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of the C++ programming
language, the object-oriented extension of C, was born on
December 30th, 1950.  How old is he today?
Answer:
Answer from program.
Today is 2023/10/05
Your birthday was 1950/12/30
Hello, Bjarne.  You are 0 years, 0 weeks, and 0 days old today




3. Software testing often involves testing code with known
"bad" input in an attempt to break it (sometimes this is
referred to as *fuzzing*).  Try breaking the `birthday_cli`
program by giving it "bad" input and observe the consequences.
Give at least two examples of potentially bad input and the
results you observe.
Answer:
Example 1:Bad input: maaz khan 1900 4 
Result:Today is 2023/10/11
Your birthday was 
Hello, maaz.  You are 0 years, 0 weeks, and 0 days old today.
Example 2:Bad input:99 / 0m 12
result:Today is 2023/10/11
Your birthday was 
Hello, 99.  You are 0 years, 0 weeks, and 0 days old today.





4. Complete all the size and range entries below.

* `char`
  size: 1 byte
  range: -128 to 127
* `short int`
  size:2 byte
  range:-32768 to 32767
* `int`
  size:4byte
  range: -2147483648 to 2147483647
* `long int`
  size:4 byte
  range:-2147483648 to  2147483647
* `float`
  size:4
  range: 7 digits of accuracy
* `double`
  size:8
  range: 15 digits of accuracy


5. Use your working currency conversion to determine
the exchange amounts for the following inputs:

  a) $250.25
  Answer:
  Half of the Dollor exchange to 88.9639 GBP
  Half of the Dollar exchange to 14374 JPY

  b) $1,000.52
  Answer:
  Half of the Dollor exchange to 355.5 GBP
  Half of the Dollar exchange to 57442 JPY


  c) $968,410.12
  Answer:
  Half of the Dollor exchange to 344270 GBP
  Half of the Dollar exchange to 55627898 JPY




6. Suppose that you had used only `int` types
in your conversion program.  Would you be able
to use it to convert the US national debt
(which as of 2020 was \$26,009,754,625,487)?
Why or why not?
Answer: NO because int can stored the number upto 32 bit and the given number greater so 32bit not sufficient for that because it limited to 32bit.




7. Mixed types

a) Run the `area` program with 3 and 4 as inputs.  
What value do you get?  Is this result correct?


b) Execute the program again with inputs 3 and 5.
Does the program give correct results?  Why not?


c) Fix the program by editing the `area.c` source
code so that the program produces correct results.
